One of my favorite appetizers growing up!

### Ingredients:

Per 8 pieces - 

* 1 cup cherry tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1.5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 2 "everything but the bagel" ciabatta rolls, available at [Trader Joe's](https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/post/everything-ciabatta-rolls)
  - Feel free to substitute with other similar breads (ciabatta, baguette, etc)
* 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
* handful of fresh basil, chopped


### Instructions:

* In a medium skillet, add the whole cherry tomatoes. On medium heat, let the tomatoes roast for ~8 minutes until the outside begins to brown slightly.

* When the tomatoes have cooked slightly, turn the heat down and add the olive oil and garlic. Pierce the tomatoes with a knife and mash down until you have a tomato sauce, of sorts. Let it simmer for ~10 minutes until the sauce has thickened.

* Add the balsamic vinegar, butter, italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix until the butter as melted and ingredients are well incorporated. Remove from heat and set aside.

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

* Slice your bread - if you're using ciabatta rolls, split them open and slice each part into half (each roll should give you 4 bruschettas). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and move your bread over there.

* On your bread, spread a spoonful of tomato sauce followed by some mozzarella and basil.

* Bake in the oven for ~10 minutes until the cheese has melted and bread has toasted. Serve and enjoy!
