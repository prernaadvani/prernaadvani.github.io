A regular at most of the family dinners my parents hosted back in India.


### Ingredients:

_Per 4-5 servings:_

* 2 cups black chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 medium roma tomatoes, diced
* 2 small white onions, diced

### Instructions:

* In a small pot, add water and salt to boil the chickpeas until tender (about 30-40 minutes). Add additional water while cooking if needed - water should always cover the chickpeas entirely.

* Drain the chickpeas (no need to rinse), and transfer to a medium bowl.

* Add the rest of the ingredients and garnish with cilantro and lemon juice.
