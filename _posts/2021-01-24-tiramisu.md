One of my requirements every time I go home is to make this for my family.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/tiramisu/).

### Ingredients:

_Per 6-8 servings:_  

* 3/4 cup strongly prepared espresso
* alcohol options - I have tried this 3 different ways, and they all work pretty well. Pick the combination that suits you: 
  - 4 tablespoons Grand Marnier mixed in with the espresso + 1/4 cup dark rum in the cream (recommended).
  - Just 1/4 cup dark rum in the cream.
  - 1/4 cup Kahlua in the cream.
* 20-25 ladyfingers
* 8 oz mascarpone 
* 2 large eggs, separated
* 1/4 cup sugar, divided (use 3 tablespoons instead if you're using Kahlua as your alcohol)
* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* pinch of salt
* unsweetened cocoa powder (I tried making this with dark hot chocolate once and it just wasn't the same. Highly recommend unsweetened cocoa.)


### Instructions:

* In a medium mixing bowl, beat the mascarpone and dark rum/Kahlua together until smooth (I used Kahlua when I took pictures for this recipe).

* Place your egg yolks in a small heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Without letting the water touch the bowl, whisk the egg yolks and add 1/8 cup sugar (or 1.5 tablespoons if you're using kahlua) gradually. Continue whisking until the eggs are light and foamy, which should take a few minutes. Immediately pour it into the mascarpone mixture and beat until incorporated.

* In a large mixing bowl, beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract together until medium peaks form.

* Fold the mascarpone cream into the heavy whipping cream.

* Add the remaining 1/8 cup of sugar (or 1.5 tablespoons if using Kahlua) and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Fold into the cream mixture.

* Add the Grand Marnier to the espresso, if using. Get ready to layer!

* Dip the ladyfingers in the espresso and place it into an 8x8 dish, creating a ladyfinger layer. Let it be a quick dip - you don't want the ladyfingers to get too soggy.

* Spread half of the cream mixture over the ladyfingers.

* Create a second layer of ladyfingers, followed by the remaining cream mixture.

* Refrigerate uncovered for 2-3 hours.

* Remove from refrigerator and using a sieve, pass a dense layer of unsweetened cocoa on top. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate again for at least 10 hours, up to 1 day. This is important for the tiramisu to set.
