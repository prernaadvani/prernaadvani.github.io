Perfect for when you want to change things up from the usual avocado toast!


### Ingredients:

* 2 slices of bread (I like using ciabatta for this)
* 3-4 tablespoons hummus (recipe link available [here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/sides/vegan/hummus/) or you can use store bought)
* 3/4 persian cucumber, sliced and quartered
* 4-5 cherry tomatoes, quartered
* 2 tablespoons red onions, diced or minced
* 1-2 tablespoons feta or goat cheese
  


### Instructions:

* Toast the bread to your desired level.


* Layer the hummus onto the toasted bread and add the rest of the ingredients on top of it, leaving the feta/goat cheese for last. Enjoy!
