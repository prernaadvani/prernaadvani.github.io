Feels a little bit like a frozen smoothie pretending to be ice cream, but it's vegan with no added sugar!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Feel Good Foodie](https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/cappuccino-nice-cream/)

### Ingredients:

_Per 4-5 servings:_  

* 3 ripe bananas, sliced (optional: slice and freeze them overnight)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup cold brew coffee (I used Trader Joe's instant cold brew)
* 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/4 cup chopped semi-sweet chocolate (optional)


### Instructions:

* Add the bananas, vanilla, and cold brew to a blender and blend until smooth.
