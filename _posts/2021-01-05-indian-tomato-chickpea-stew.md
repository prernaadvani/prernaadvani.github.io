One of my first indian stew attempts without a recipe.

### Ingredients:

Per 3-4 servings:

* 1 tablespoon olive or avocado oil
* 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes, cut in half
* 4 oz tomato sauce 
* 2 oz tomato paste 
* 3 teaspoons minced garlic 
* 3 teaspoons chilli powder⠀
* 3 teaspoons curry powder⠀
* 4 teaspoons cumin powder
* 2 teaspoons onion powder⠀
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1/2 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 cup mexican corn (I used [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/green-giant-mexicorn/0002000010453))
* 1 15-oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1 can coconut milk 
* 1.5 cups baby spinach
* cilantro, for garnish

### Instructions:

* Heat oil in a medium pot and add the cherry tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, garlic, and spices. Stir occasionally and cook for a few minutes.

* Add the bell pepper, corn, chickpeas, and coconut milk. Mix and cook on a low simmer for ~10 minutes until the sauce has thickened.

* Add the spinach and continue cooking and stiring until it has wilted, which will take a few minutes.
