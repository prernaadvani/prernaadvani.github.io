Eggs are a Sunday morning tradition in the Advani household, and this is how my dad and I like 'em.


### Ingredients:

Per 2 servings:

* 4 eggs
* pinch of salt
* pinch of pepper
* pinch of turmeric 
* 1 small green bell pepper, diced
* 1 white onion, diced
* 1 small green chilli, minced
* 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1.5 teaspoons olive or avocado oil
* 2 roma tomatoes, halved

### Instructions:

* Grease a small pan, and add your halved tomatoes, center facing down. Cover and cook for ~8 minutes on low heat, and then set aside. No need to flip the tomato and cook the other side - just cooking it face down does the trick. It should be a little blackened when it's cooked.

* Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, crack your eggs and add salt, pepper, and turmeric. Beat until scrambled. Next, add the bell pepper, onion, chilli, and cilantro. Mix until incorporated.

* In a medium pan, add the oil. When heated, add egg mix and let it cook for about 30 seconds. Then, begin scrambling the eggs until the eggs are well cooked and the vegetables have softened slightly. While scrambling, break the eggs into small pieces. This takes about 6 minutes on medium-high heat.

* Transfer eggs to a plate along with tomatoes. Breakfast is ready!

* Sometimes, we like to use a 1/2 green bell pepper and a 1/2 red bell pepper to add some color.
