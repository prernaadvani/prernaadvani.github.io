One of my favorite ways to consume a potato.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Once Upon A Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/oven-fried-potato-latkes.html)

### Ingredients:

_Per ~8 latke:_ 

* 3/4 cup vegetable oil
* 2 russet potatoes, peeled
* 1 small yellow onion
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour



### Instructions:

* Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. 

* Once preheated, add the oil to a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven for ~10 minutes to heat.

* Meanwhile, grate your potatoes and onion.

* Mix the potatoes with the onions and transfer to a sieve. Press down with paper towels to release excess water - I went through a ton of paper towels in this step, and might use a kitchen towel next time to reduce waste.

* In a small mixing bowl, combine the eggs, salt, baking powder, and flour.

* Transfer the potato/onion mix to the egg mixture and combine.

* Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Scoop ~1/4 cup of latke batter and place in the oil, leaving some distance in between. Using the back of a measuring cup, press down to flatten slightly.

* Bake for ~20 minutes, and then flip the latkes. Bake for another ~10 minutes, and then remove from the oven. Place on paper towels to remove excess oil.

* Latkes are commonly served with apple sauce or sour cream. Personally, I like them with tzatziki (recipe link available [here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/sides/tzatziki/). Enjoy!
