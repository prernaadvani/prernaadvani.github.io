The perfect dessert to complete your thanksgiving meal.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Tasty](https://tasty.co/recipe/pumpkin-cheesecake-swirl-bars)

### Ingredients:

Makes about 12 bars - 

_For the crust:_

* 2 cups graham cracket crumbs (I used [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/keebler-graham-cracker-crumbs/0007891328002))
* 2.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (I used McCormick's)
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

_For the cheesecake:_

* 32 oz cream cheese, softened (I used [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/philadelphia-original-cream-cheese/0002100004024))
* 1.5 cups granulated sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1/3 cup all purpose flour
* 15 oz pumpkin puree/canned pumpkin (I used [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/simple-truth-organic-solid-packed-100-pure-pumpkin/0001111089980))
* 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice


### Instructions:

* First, we make the crust! In a medium bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the crust and mix. In a 9x13 baking dish, place some parchment paper with extra paper on either side of the dish (this will function as a sling to pull the cheesecake out). Grease the dish lightly if your parchment paper does not cover the entire dish.

* Transfer the graham cracker crumb mixture to the dish and press down, creating an even and somewhat solid bottom layer. Place in the freezer.

* In a large mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Gradually, add the sugar and continue blending. Add the eggs and continue blending. Add the flour and continue blending. 

* Remove 1 cup of the cheesecake mixture into a small bowl and set aside. To the rest of the mixture, add the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice. Blend until well incorporated.

* Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

* Remove the crust from the freezer and pour the pumpkin filling into the dish. Using a spoon, dollop bits of the separated cheesecake mixture over the pumpkin filling.

* Using a toothpick or other thin pointed tool (I used a chopstick), swirl the cheesecake into the pumpkin batter.

* Bake for 35-40 minutes, and then let it cook for at least 30 minutes. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving.

* To serve, use the parchment paper as a sling to lift the cheesecake out and slice into bars. 

* I apologize for the bad picture I took of the bar - I forgot to photograph it until I was down to the last bar at my thanksgiving dinner. I promise it tastes better than it looks!
