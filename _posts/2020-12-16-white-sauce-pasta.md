The result when carbonara, cacio e pepe, and bechamel combine forces.


### Ingredients:

Makes about 2 servings - 

* 1 teaspoon black peppercorn
* 1 tablespoon olive oil 
* 1 egg yolk
* 1/4 standard box spaghetti (4 oz)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1.5 tablespoons all purpose flour
* 3/4 cup half and half
* 3/4 cup grated pecorino romano, plus some extra as a garnish (in a pinch, you can use parmesan)
* salt, to taste


### Instructions:

* Boil and cook pasta according to directions on the box. Once cooked, reserve 1/4 cup pasta water and drain. Set aside.

* While the pasta cooks, in a small skillet, combine the peppercorn and olive oil over medium heat. Let the peppercorns toast for a few minutes, and then take it off the heat. You can leave it in the skillet or transfer to a bowl for later.

* In a small-medium saucepan, melt butter. Next, add the minced garlic and stir for a minute or two until the garlic is aromatic. Next, add the flour and mix to combine. Let the mixture cook for a minute or two, and then very slowly begin adding the half and half, stirring to combine between each small addition. Continuously mixing and slowly combining will prevent the sauce from becoming clumpy.

* Once the sauce has thickened a little over heat, add the egg yolk and the toasted peppercorns. Stir to combine, and then add the cooked pasta and pasta water. Mix and stir for a few minutes, and then take the saucepan off the heat. 

* Transfer pasta to a bowl, sprinkle some percorino romano on the top, and enjoy!
