"Everything that involves coffee, by nature, is good" -Aristotle, probably in his head.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Tasty](https://www.buzzfeed.com/baileysde/baileys-salted-caramel-affogato)

### Ingredients:

_Per 6-8 servings:_  

* 1 cup heavy cream 
* 1/2 cup condensed milk 
* 1/6 cup Kahlua

_For the salted caramel:_

* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons Kahlua
* 1/2 tablespoons flaky salt


### Instructions:

* In a medium mixing bowl, beat the whipping cream until stiff peaks form.

* In a small saucepan, add the butter and sugar. Stir constantly for a few minutes, and then add the rest of the ingredients. Mix to incorporate and then remove from heat.

* Drizzle the caramel over the whipped cream mixture. Using a toothpick (or other such thin object), swirl the caramel into the whipped cream.

* Freeze for at least 4 hours, and then serve with a shot of espresso. Enjoy!
