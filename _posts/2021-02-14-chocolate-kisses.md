Happy Valentine's Day! I made these for my loved ones this year and it was quite successful :)

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Once Upon A Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/chocolate-kisses-baci-di-cioccolato.html)

### Ingredients:

Makes about 60 cookies/30 sandwiches-

_For the cookies:_

* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 cup salted butter, softened (or use unsalted butter and add 1/2 teaspoon salt)
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1/2 cup almond flour
* 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus more for coating the cookies
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon dark rum 

_For the filling:_

* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 3 oz semisweet chocolate
* 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened

### Instructions:

* Mix the flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a small bowl and set aside.

* In a medium mixing bow, beat the butter and powdered sugar together until soft and creamy. Add the vanilla and rum, and continue beating.

* Using a spatula, smooth out your cookie batter.

* Transfer the batter to a piece of plastic wrap, wrap it, and then flatten to a disk shape.

* Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to a few hours if you have things to do in between. I refrigerated for ~6 hours.

* Close to when you're ready to start baking the cookies, make the filling. Microwave the heavy cream for ~30-60 seconds until hot. Add the chocolate and butter, and let it fit for a minute or two to melt. Whisk to combine and set aside to cool - this can take anywhere from 30-45 minutes. You want the consistency to be just firm enough to spread in between the cookies.

Note: my quantity of filling exceeds what the recipe calls for - I made extra for some chocolate covered strawberries.

* Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.

* Remove the cookie dough from the fridge and cut into 3 pieces.

* Working with one piece at a time, roll into a thin-ish log.

* Cut the log into ~1/2 inch pieces.

* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and pour some granulated sugar into a shallow bowl. 

* Roll each piece of cookie dough into a ball and cover with sugar. Place it on the baking sheet, leaving some distance to spread.

* Bake for 12-14 minutes until they are puffed and cracking near the top.

* Remove from oven and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes, and then move them to a cooling rack or just somewhere off the baking sheet to cool completely.

* Repeat with the remaining 2 pieces of cookie dough.

* When the cookies have cooled completely and the chocolate filling has firmed enough, you will be ready to make the sandwiches.

This is what my filling consistency looked like when I was ready to sandwich.

* Pair up cookies according to size and using a knife, add the filling in between the cookies. Set aside to cool and for the filling to firm up even more.
