* Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

* Lightly grease an 8x8 baking dish and spread 1/4 cup marinara to the bottom. Layer 2 lasagna noodles on top (cut and overlap noodles to make them fit, as necessary). Spread half of the cottage cheese + veggie mixture on top of the lasagna noodles, followed by 1/2 cup marinara and 1/4 cup shredded cheese.

* Cover the lasagna with foil and bake covered for ~15 minutes. Remove the cover, rotate the dish, and bake for another ~15 minutes until the cheese is darkened and bubbling.

* Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil. Let the lasagna cool for ~15 minutes, and then serve!
