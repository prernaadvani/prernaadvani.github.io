Perfect for these cold winter days.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/egg-drop-soup/#tasty-recipes-59802).

### Ingredients:

Per 3-4 servings:

* 2.5 cups chicken broth
* 1.25 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 2-3 green onions, diced (save some as garnish)
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

* In a small saucepan, combine the chicken broth, cornstarch, ginger, and garlic. Set to medium heat and wait for it to come to a simmer.

* Once the liquid is simmering, very slowly pour in the beaten eggs while stirring continuously. You want a very thin stream of egg being poured - I use a measuring cup for this step, but you can also put your beaten eggs into a zip-lock bag and cut a small slit in the corner to create a thin egg pour.

* When all of the egg has been incorporated, continue stirring for a minute and then take it off heat. Add the green onions, salt, and pepper. Transfer to a bowl, garnish with green onion, and enjoy!
