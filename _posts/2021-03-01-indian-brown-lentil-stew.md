Healthy, vegan, and perfect with rice or naan!

I used an adaptation of Kanchan Koya's recipe, available in [here](https://thefeedfeed.com/chiefspicemama/kali-dal)

### Ingredients:

_Per 4-5 servings:_

* 1 cup urad dal (whole black lentils)
* 1 small white onion
* 1 tablespoon avocado or olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* pinch of chili powder (increase if you like spicier food)
* 6 oz tomato sauce
* 1.5 tablespoons butter (I used the vegan kind)
* salt, to taste
* cream or yogurt, as garnish (optional)
* cilantro (fresh or dried), as garnish (optional)


### Instructions:

* Soak the lentils for 6-12 hours (overnight is easiest - just make sure you put them in plenty of water)

* Drain and rinse the lentils post-soak. Place in a pot with 3x as much water as lentils and set to medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce heat and simmer covered for 60-70 minutes until lentils are completely tender, adding more water if necessary. Drain and set aside.

* Add the lentils and mix to combine. Add salt simmer for 15-25 minutes. Add more water depending on your desired consistency. You can also use a hand blender to blend the stew a little bit, but not until completely smooth. Some chunks are good.
