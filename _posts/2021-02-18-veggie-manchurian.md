One of my favorite Indo-Chinese dishes!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Holy Cow Vegan](https://holycowvegan.net/veg-manchurian/)

### Ingredients:

Per 8 manchurians:

_For the manchurians:_

* 1/4 head cabbage, shredded (I used purple cabbage)
* 2 carrot, shredded
* 1/2 white onion, finely chopped 
* 1/2 green bell pepper, finely chopped
* 1 serrano chili pepper or 1/2 habanero pepper, deseeded and minced (I used habanero. Adjust according to spice tolerance) 
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* salt, to taste
* 2 tablespoons corn starch 
* 1/4 cup all purpose flour
* vegetable oil, for cooking

_For the sauce:_

* 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 3 teaspoons minced garlic 
* 1 serrano chili pepper or 1/2 habanero pepper, deseeded and minced (I used habanero. Adjust according to spice tolerance) 
* 1/2 green bell pepper, cut lengthwise and halved
* 1/2 white onion, cut lengthwise and halved
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* 1/4 teaspoons ground ginger
* 2.5 cups vegetable or chicken stock 
* salt to taste
* 2-3 tablespoons corn starch
* 1-2 green onions, chopped


### Instructions:

* First, we make the manchurian balls. Combine all of the vegetables in a small-medium bowl and mix.

* Add the spices and mix.

* Mix the cornstarch in one tablespoon of water until diluted and add it to the vegetable mix. Add the flour, and mix until well combined.

* Heat the oil in a nonstick pan. Divide the vegetable mixture into 8 equal parts and roll each part into a ball. The mixture isn't going to be sticky in itself, but should somewhat hold together. If it's too liquid, add some more flour.

* Add the vegetable balls to the oil and cook for a few minutes. If you're shallow frying like I did, flip, turn and roll the balls around periodically to cook all sides. Alternatively, you can fry them entirely.

* When cooked, transfer to a bowl or plate lined with paper towels/napkins to soak up extra oil.

* Next, we make the sauce. Make sure your vegetables are chopped and ready to go ahead of time since this sauce comes together very quickly.

* Heat the oil in a nonstick pan. Add the garlic and mix for ~30 seconds, and then add the chilli and vegetables. Stir continuously for a minute or two.

* Add all of the sauces along with the ginger. Mix to combine for a minute, and then add the vegetable/chicken stock. Bring to a boil and add salt to taste. The sauce will thicken slightly, but will still be on the thinner side.

* Dilute the corn starch in 2 tablespoons of water and gradually add it to the sauce, stirring continuously. You may not need all of the corn starch - stop adding when the sauce thickness suits your preferences.

* When you reach your desired sauce consistency, add the manchurian balls.

* Serve with any fried rice or noodle dish ([here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/thai/rice/not%20vegetarian/thai-shrimp-fried-rice/) is a fried rice recipe from my website). Enjoy!
