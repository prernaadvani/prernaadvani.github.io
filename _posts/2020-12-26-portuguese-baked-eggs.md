If shakshuka had a sister, this would be it. 

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Bon Appetit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/portuguese-baked-eggs)

### Ingredients:

Per 1-2 servings:

* 1 tablespoon olive or avocado oil
* 1/2 green bell pepper, cut lengthwise and halved
* 1/2 red bell pepper, cut lengthwise and halved
* 1/2 red or white onion, cut lengthwise and halved (I switch between red and white depending on what I have on hand)
* 1 beefsteak tomato, diced
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1/4 tablespoon jalapeno (I used jalapeno paste)
* 1 teaspoon basil
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon chilli powder
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1-2 eggs (depending on how egg-y you want it)
* 1 tablespoon ricotta (sometimes I like substituting with cottage cheese or skipping it altogether)
* 1/4 cup grated white cheddar cheese
* 1 tablespoon grated parmesan or pecorino romano 


### Instructions:

* Heat oil in a medium pot, and add the peppers and onion. Stir occasionally and let them cook for ~10 minutes.

* Once the vegetables are soft and starting to brown, add the tomato, garlic, jalapeno, basil, oregano, chilli powder, and paprika. Mix to incorporate. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered until the sauce has thickened and the consistency is less solid, which should take about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally as it cooks.

* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

* To bake the eggs, I created a compartment out of foil that covered about 2/3 of a loaf pan since I didn't have anything smaller in size. Since the serving size is small, using a full loaf pan or anything bigger would thin out the layer of tomato/bell pepper/onion mixture. If you have a baking dish that's smaller in size, feel free to use that instead of the loaf pan.

* Grease the foil compartment (or baking dish) and pour the mixture in there. Using the back of a spoon, make small divots in the mixtures - the number of divots should equal the number of eggs you're using and should be spaced out as far from each other as possible. To the divots, add the ricotta and then crack your egg(s) on top. Add the cheddar, parmesan, salt, and pepper on top of the egg(s), and bake for ~15 minutes. If the yolks are slightly runny, that's okay - they will cook further after removing from the oven.

* Pour the mixture out of the foil/baking dish and into a bowl and serve with toasted bread.
