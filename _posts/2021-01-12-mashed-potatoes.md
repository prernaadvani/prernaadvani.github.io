There's no bad way to eat a potato but this one is the best.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Gimme Some Oven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/best-mashed-potatoes-recipe/#tasty-recipes-60055).

### Ingredients:

Per 3-5 servings - 

* 2.5 lbs potatoes (I used russet and kept the skins on for all the nutrients, but feel free to peel if desired)
* 2 teaspoons minced garlic
* pinch of salt
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/2 cup half and half
* 2 teaspoons Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute
* salt, to taste
* 1/2 ground peppercorns
* 2 oz cream cheese
* parsley, for garnish


### Instructions:

* Cut the potatoes into chunks and place them to a large pot with water that covers the potatoes entirely.

* Add the salt and garlic to the pot and set to high heat. Once the water has boiled, reduce heat to medium-high and continue cooking for ~20 minutes, or until fully cooked. Drain the potatoes, no need to rinse.

* In a small pot, add the butter and melt. Once melted, add the half and half, 21 seasoning salute, pepper, and salt. Take off heat and set aside once mixed - you don't want to boil the half and half.

* Transfer the potatoes to a small mixing bowl and using a potato masher, mash the potatoes. Pour the butter mixture over the mashed potatoes and mix. Add the cream cheese and mix. Sprinkle the parsley as a garnish and serve.
