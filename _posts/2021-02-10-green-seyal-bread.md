### Instructions:

* First, make the green paste. In a food chopper or processor, add all of the ingredients for the green paste and blend until coarsely ground, making sure that it is not blended to a pulp. You donâ€™t want a smooth paste - some chunks are good.

* In a medium saucepan, heat the oil and add all of the spices for the bread except the mango powder. Mix and add 4 tablespoons of the green paste. Mix well, and then add the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes soften, adding a little water if necessary. This should take ~5-7 minutes on medium heat.

* Add 2 cups of water and the salt to the mixture, and combine until incorporated.

* When the water comes to a boil, add the bread gradually and soaking completely. Lower the flame to a simmer and mix gently until the bread has absorbed the liquid - be careful not to mash and break the bread.

* Add the mango powder and mix again. Remove from heat and serve.
