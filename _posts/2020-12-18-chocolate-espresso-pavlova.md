If there's only one thing you make from this recipe website, let it be this.

Fun fact: it was originally made in Australia/New Zealand in honor of Anna Pavlova, a famous Russian ballet dancer, around when she was on tour. It remains a popular Christmas time dessert in the region!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Once Upon a Chef](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/double-chocolate-pavlova-with-marscapone-cream-raspberries.html)

### Ingredients:

Per 5-6 servings - 

_For the pavlova:_

* 3 large egg whites
* a pinch of salt
* 3/4 cup fine sugar
  - _Note: if you don't have fine sugar, you can put granulated sugar in a food processor and pulse it a few times._
* 1.5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (I used [Baking Cocoa](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-sugar-free-baking-cocoa/0001111076927))
* 1/2 teaspoon red wine vinegar
* 2 oz chopped semisweet chocolate

_For the cream:_

* 4 oz espresso mascarpone cheese (1/2 of a standard 8 oz container)

  - Alternatively, you can use regular mascarpone and add 1/4 cup brewed espresso.
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/8 cup sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

_For the topping:_
* 3/4 cup fresh raspberries, quartered
* 2 oz semisweet chocolate


### Instructions:

* We start by making the base of the pavlova. In a medium-large mixing bowl, add the egg whites and the salt. Using an electric mixer with a whisk attahment, beat the mixture until it's light and foamy, about a minute or two. Slowly, add the sugar and continue whisking between each addition until you get to stiff peaks. This process takes a little bit longer than I originally anticipated, around 10 minutes. 

* Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

* Using a sieve/sifter, pass the cocoa powder through, add the red wine vinegar, and then the chopped chocolate. Fold the mixture until fully incorporated. The texture should be similar to whipped cream.

* The pavlova is ready to bake! Traditionally, you would line a baking sheet with parchment paper and mound the mixture in a circular shape. I personally didn't feel very confident in making a cake-like structure in a flat sheet, so I lined an 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper instead and mounded the pavlova in there (hence the square-ish shape). I transferred the pavlova (along with the parchment paper) to a flat baking sheet during the last 20 minutes of baking to cook the edges a little better.

* Bake for ~60 minutes (transfer from 8x8 pan to flat baking sheet after the first 40 minutes, if you choose to bake it this way). 

* When you pull it out of the oven, the pavlova should be dry to the touch on the outside and soft/fudgey on the inside. It may have some cracks on the outside surface - that's completely normal.

* Let the pavlova cool for at least 30 minutes. Cooling it by leaving it in the oven after turning it off and cracking the door open slightly will help it cool down slowly.

* You can leave the pavlova covered in the fridge for up to 12 hours if you're making this ahead of time. Otherwise, after it has cooled and shortly before serving, make the cream. In a medium-large mixing bowl, add the espresso mascarpone, heavy cream, and vanilla essence. Using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, beat until all of the ingredients are incorporated. Gradually, add the sugar and keep whisking between each addition until you reach soft peaks.

* Transfer the pavlova to a serving plate and separate the parchment paper. Mound the whipped cream onto the pavlova in an even layer.
