_Per bowl:_

* 1 teaspoon olive or avocado oil
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's Everything but the Elote seasoning
* 1/2 bell pepper, diced or sliced (your choice of color)
* 1/3 cup cooked rice (your choice - I used basmati in the image but I usually use short grain).
* 1/3 cup black beans (substitute with pinto if desired)
* 1/2 medium cucumber, sliced and quartered
* 1/4 cup corn
* 1/4 cup Mexican 3 Cheese blend (substitute with other cheese or increase quantity if desired)
* 1/4 cup guac (recipe available [here](https://prernaadvani.github.io/sides/vegan/mexican/guacamole/))
* 1/4 cup sour cream 
* 1 tablespoon Trader Joe's pepita salsa OR [chipotle salsa cremosa](https://www.kroger.com/p/herdez-medium-chipotle-salsa-cremosa/0007287887038)



### Instructions:

* In a small skillet, add the oil and heat on medium heat. Add the bell peppers, seasoning, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Remove from heat and set aside.

* In a bowl, create a base layer with the rice and beans. Top with the rest of the ingredients, including the cooked bell peppers.
