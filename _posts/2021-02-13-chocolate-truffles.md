Homemade > store bought, always. (There's a secret ingredient)

The secret ingredient is love. Too cheesy? 

### Ingredients:

Makes about 15 truffles-

* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 8 oz semisweet chocolate
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* unsweetened cocoa, for topping
  - Feel free to substitute with sprinkles, crushed nuts, or other desired toppings.

### Instructions:

* Microwave the heavy cream for ~60 seconds until hot. Add the chocolate and butter, and let it fit for a minute or two to melt. Whisk to combine and then add the vanilla extract.

* Set aside to cool for ~45 minutes until it is no longer hot and firmed up a little.

* Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

* When the chocolate has cooled completely, scoop out the desired amount of chocolate and shape into a ball (I made a few different sizes for different consumer preferences). Cover in desired topping (I used unsweetened cocoa - since the chocolate is fairly sweet, the thin bitter outer layer helped even out the sugar) and serve room temperature or after refrigerating!
