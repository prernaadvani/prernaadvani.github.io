For my fellow grillers that enjoy an adequate amount of spice.

Sharing my parent's recipe - thank you, parents!

### Ingredients:

_Per 2 servings:_

* 2 chicken breasts, cut into medium cubes
* 1.5 tablespoon olive or avocado oil (plus 1.5 additional tablespoon for cooking)
* 4 teaspoons chicken tikka masala powder (National or Shan are both good brands, available at the indian store)
* 4 tablespoons plain yogurt
* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chilli powder
* 2 teaspoon ginger garlic paste
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 2 teaspoon kasuri methi 
* Salt, to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon orange dye (optional)



### Instructions:

* In a medium bowl, add all of the ingredients for the chicken except for the reserved 1.5 tablespoons of oil for cooking later and mix. Cover and let it sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

* To cook the chicken, you can either grill or cook on the stove. 

* If you’re grilling, add the chicken to skewers, brush with oil, and grill for 15-20 minutes until cooked and blackened slightly. You may need to brush oil again after flipping the chicken on the grill.

* If you’re cooking on the stove, add 1.5 tablespoons of oil to a medium grill pan, if you have one, or a regular non stick pan. Add the pieces of chicken, cover, and cook for 10 minutes on medium high heat. Uncover, flip the chicken pieces, cover, and continue cooking for ~5 minutes. After this, cook uncovered and stir frequently until the chicken has fully cooked.

* Remove from heat and serve. 

* This is traditionally served on a bed of sliced onions with mint chutney and lemon wedges.
