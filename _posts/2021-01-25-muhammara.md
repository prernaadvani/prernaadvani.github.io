Muhammara is the new hummus (or I predict it will be soon)!

I used an adaptation of Reem Assil's recipe, available in [The Immigrant Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Immigrant-Cookbook-Recipes-America-Great/dp/1566560381/ref=asc_df_1566560381/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312140312523&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1704980720432810813&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052538&hvtargid=pla-407598417986&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=60258872577&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312140312523&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1704980720432810813&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9052538&hvtargid=pla-407598417986). 

### Ingredients:

_Per 1 cup muhammara (double or triple the recipe - this quantity is more of a sample size):_

* 2 red bell peppers
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (plus some extra for garnish)
* 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1/2 tablespoons pomegranate molasses
* 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper flakes (substitute with a mix of paprika and cayenne, if needed)
* salt, to taste
* 2-3 tablespoons olive oil 



### Instructions:

* Begin by roasting the bell peppers. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, place the peppers on it, and roast for ~25 minutes, turning them a few times, until the skins are charred.

* Transfer the peppers to a sealed bag (or a small bowl with plastic wrap on top). Let them cook completely, and then peel the skins, cut the stems, and deseed.

* Combine the walnuts and breadcrumbs in a food processor and pulse until you arrive at a somewhat coarse, cornmeal like texture.

* Add the rest of the ingredients except the olive oil and process until smooth. Slowly add the olive oil - start with 2 tablespoons and add a little extra to bring it to the right consistency.

* Transfer to a bowl and garnish with walnuts. Alternatively, you can garnish with pomegranate or parsley as well. Enjoy!
