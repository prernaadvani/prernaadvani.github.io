Dangerously addictive. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/guac/guac.png)

### Ingredients:

* 2 avocados
* 1 lime (I have experimented with using up to 2 limes before and I think the sweet spot is about 1.25 limes, although that's a rather inconvenient amount)
  - _Note: highly recommend using fresh lime instead of lime juice_
* 1 small shallot, minced
* 1/8 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1/2 - 1 jalapeno pepper, minced (depending on spice tolerance).
* sea salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin

_Optional:_
* 1 teaspoon "Everything but the Elote" seasoning from Trader Joe's
* 2 tablespoons of Pico (you can buy it ready to go at Trader Joe's or elsewhere, or make it fresh).
  - Alternatively, you can mince a few cherry tomatoes and about 1/8 onion


### Instructions:

* In a small mixing bowl, use a potato masher or a spoon to mash the avocado. Add all of the other ingredients, juice the lime, and mix. Enjoy!
