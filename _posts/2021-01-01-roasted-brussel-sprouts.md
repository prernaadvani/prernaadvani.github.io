New year new recipe! 


### Ingredients:

Per 4 servings:

* 1.5 lb bag of brussel sprouts
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste


### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

* Start by removing the stems and halving your brussel sprouts (quarter them if they're especially large). Discard the outer leaves that have fallen off.

* I used an 8x8 baking dish in this image, but I typically use a baking sheet and line it with parchment paper or foil - spreading the sprouts out help them cook evenly, and I recommend the baking sheet. In your baking dish/sheet, add the olive oil and seasonings. Toss until combined.

* Roast for ~12 minutes, toss, and roast for another ~12 minutes.

* After the sprouts have been cooked, add the balsamic vinegar and serve.
