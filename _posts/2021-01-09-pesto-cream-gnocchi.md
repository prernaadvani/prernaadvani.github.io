Whoever decided to combine pasta and potatoes had the right idea.

### Ingredients:

_Per 2-3 servings:_

* 1 lb basil gnocchi or regular gnocchi (I used [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/private-selection-basil-pesto-gnocchi/0001111003254))
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 teaspoon garlic
* 1 cup half and half
* 1/4 cup pesto
* 1 roma tomato, diced
* 1 cup mozzarella
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste



### Instructions:

* First, cook the gnocchi according to instructions on the package.

* Just before the gnocchi is finished cooking, begin working on the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add the garlic. Stir for a minute or two, and then add the half and half followed by the pesto. Let the sauce simmer and cook for a few minutes.

* Next, add the cooked gnocchi and the tomatoes. Top with the mozzarella (preserve some for garnish). Mix and cook for a minute or two.
