A lovely cake, spice, and carrot combination.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/my-favorite-carrot-cake-recipe/#tasty-recipes-69458)

### Ingredients:

Per 5-6 servings - 

_For the cake:_

* 1 cup chopped pecans (substitute with walnuts or skip, if desired)
* 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup canola oil (substitute with melted coconut oil, if desired)
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 medium banana, mashed
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1.25 cups self rising flour (substitute with 1.25 cups all purpose flour + 1 teaspoon baking powder, if desired)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* pinch of salt
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 2 cups loosely packed grated carrots (about 2 carrots)

_For the frosting:_

* 8 oz block cream cheese, at room temperature
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2 cups powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* pinch of salt


### Instructions:

* Begin by toasting the pecans. Layer a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread out your pecans/walnuts on it. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees and toast the nuts for ~7 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool.

* While the pecans are cooling, make the cake batter. In one small bowl, mix the brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, eggs, mashed banana, and vanilla. Mix until incorporated.

* In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix until incorporated.

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

* Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient bowl and mix until completely incorporated with no clumps (except some banana clumps if you left it a little chunky).

* Add the carrots and half of the toasted pecans (the other 1/2 cup is for garnish) and mix.

* Layer an 8x8 dish with parchment paper and grease it. Pour the cake batter into the dish and bake for 32-38 minutes until the cake is cooked through the middle. Let the cake cool completely.

* While the cake cools, make the cake frosting. In a small mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and butter. Using an electric mixer, whisk until smooth.

* Add the sugar, vanilla, and salt gradually and continue whisking until creamy.

* When the cake has cooled completely, move the parchment paper with the cake to a baking sheet and ice the cake. I had a decent amount of icing leftover since I applied a thin icing layer, so you may have some leftover too if you do the same.

* Garnish with the remaining 1/2 cup of toasted pecans and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
