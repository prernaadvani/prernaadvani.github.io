My sister's pancake recipe! Tagged as breakfast but meal times are a social construct. Eat this whenever.


### Ingredients:

_Per 5 medium sized pancakes:_

* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 3.5 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1.5 cups milk (we used almond milk due to lactose intolerance)
* 1 egg 
* 3 tablespoons melted butter
* ~2 oz chopped semi sweet chocolate
* 1/2 cup blueberries, for serving (substitute with your personal preferences)

### Instructions:

* Begin by making the batter - in a medium mixing bowl, add all of the ingredients except the chocolate and blueberries. Mix until combined and smooth with no clumps.

* Lightly grease a small pan and set to medium heat. Pour ~1/5 of the batter in a circular shape when the pan is heated and cook until you see bubbles arise on most of the top surface. Check to see if the bottom has cooked, and then flip if yes. Otherwise, let it cook for slightly longer and then flip when cooked. Once you have flipped the pancake, cook the other side until brown and remove from heat.
