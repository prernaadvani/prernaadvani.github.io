One of my mother's signature dishes!


### Ingredients:

Per 3-4 servings.

_For the potato mix:_

* 5 small russet potatoes 
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 2 medium green chilies, seeds removed and finely chopped
* ~1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 
* 2 teaspoons coriander powder
* 2 teaspoons dry mango powder
* 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala (available at the Indian store, we use the MDH or Shan brand)
* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon cumin 
* Pinch of asafetida
* Salt, to taste
* 5 teaspoons olive or avocado oil, for cooking (~1/2 teaspoon per paratha, feel free to substitute with ghee)

_For the dough:_

* 1.5 cups wheat flour, plus an additional 1/2 cup for cooking 
* Pinch of salt
* Pinch of pepper
* 1 tablespoon of olive or avocado oil

### Instructions:

* Boil the potatoes - add cold water to a large pot, add the potatoes, and cook on medium heat for ~20 minutes until potatoes are tender.

* Meanwhile, make the dough - combine all of the ingredients for the dough except the oil and the 1/2 cup of flour for cooking later. Gradually add ~1/4 cup water until you make a dough and knead for a minute or two until smooth. It should not be sticky at all and not too hard either (medium soft). 

* Add more water if necessary and then shape the dough into a ball. Apply oil to the dough and roll it so that oil covers the whole outside surface. Cover and set aside.

* Once the potatoes are cooked, bring them to a medium bowl and using a potato masher, mash them until smooth with no potato clumps.

* Add the rest of the potato mix ingredients except the oil and mix until incorporated.

* Divide the mix into 9 equal parts.

* Return to the dough - divide it into 9 equal pieces, and shape each of them into a ball. 

* Time to roll! Pick one out of the nine pieces of dough and cover with flour. On a clean surface, use a rolling pin to roll it out into a medium thick circle. In the center of the circle, place one out of the 9 pieces of potato mix.

* Fold the dough over the potato mix so that the dough covers it entirely.

* Place the dough in your hands and roll it again into a round shape. Cover it in flour once again and using a rolling pin, roll it out to a thin circle.

* Lightly grease a non stick pan and place the rolled out potato bread. Let it cook for a minute or two, and then flip to cook the other side for another minute or two. Flip one more time, and add 1/2 teaspoon of oil around the edges of the bread and press down with a spatula. Flip one last time, and add a little more oil if needed. Let it cook for a minute and place into a plate when cooked.

* Repeat 8 more times for the remaining dough and potatoes. For time efficiency, it might be helpful to roll out the next dough while the previous dough is cooking on the stove. 

* Enjoy!
