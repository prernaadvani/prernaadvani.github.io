Less vegan but still very good


### Ingredients:

_Per bowl:_

* 1/4 cup cooked rice (I used basmati)
* 1/2 tablespoon pesto (I used genovese pesto)
* Handful of baby spinach
* 2-3 falafel - recipe link [here](https://prernaadvani.github.io/baked-falafel/)
* 1/8 cup diced red onion
* 1/8 cup diced tomatoes (a handful of diced cherry tomatoes should do the trick)
  - Alternatively, you can use 1/4 balela salad instead of the tomato and red onion (recommended, available at Trader Joe's or you can make it yourself)
* 1/4 cup hummus (store bought, or you can make your own which is one step ahead of me)
* tzatziki: (note: makes enough for about 4 bowls)
  - 1 cup greek yogurt
  - 1 persian cucumber, peeled and minced (or use 3/4 if you love cucumbers a little less than I do)
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 teaspoons minced garlic
  - salt, to taste
  - pepper, to taste
* feta, as garnish
* parsley, as garnish
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)

_For my vegan readers: skip the tzatziki, feta, and make sure that the pesto you're using is vegan (or skip that too)._

### Instructions:

* Chop baby spinach

* In a small bowl, add the rice and pesto and mix.

* In another small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the tzatziki and mix.

* Assemble! You can create a layered bowl:

  - base layer: pesto rice and spinach
  - middle layer: falafel, tzatziki, hummus
  - top layer: onion, tomato, feta, parsley, lemon juice
  
* Alternatively, you can create a compartmentalized bowl like I did:

  - base layer: spinach
  - add falafel, rice, tzatziki, hummus, tomatoes, and onions in a respective area of the bowl each
  - top with feta, lemon juice, and parsley.
