Also known as masala chai, this drink is a staple of Mumbai (where I spent most of my childhood).

Sharing my mother's recipe! 

### Ingredients:

_Per cup:_ 

* 3/4 cup water
* 1â€“2 tablespoons loose leaf black tea
* Pinch of ground cardamom
* 2 mint leaves
* 1/4 inch ginger, roughly chopped (substitute with pinch of ginger powder)
* Pinch of fennel seeds
* 1 teaspoon sugar (optional)
* 1/4 cup oat milk 


### Instructions:

* Add water to a small pot along with the rest of the ingredients except the milk. 

* Once the water comes to a rapid boil, take it off the heat and strain it into a cup.

* Add the sugar (if using) and the milk. Note that oat milk is usually slightly sweetened already, so you may not need to add the sugar (I personally like to go without it). Stir and enjoy!
