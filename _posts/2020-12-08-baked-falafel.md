Who knew something vegan could be so good?

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Eating Bird Food](https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/easy-baked-falafel/)

### Ingredients:

Makes about 8-10 falafels - 

* 1 15-oz can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1/4 cup diced red onion
* 1.5 tsp minced garlic (or 3 cloves)
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
* 1/8 cup fresh mint, chopped
* salt, to taste
* 1/2 cup panko, divided into 2 parts 
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil + an additional 3 tablespoons if you would like to get them crispier
  - alternatively, you can use olive oil
* 1/2 lemon
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 3 tablespoons of self-rising flour 
  - alternatively, you can use 3 tablespoons of flour and add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* pinch of paprika (optional)
* pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
* some cilantro, if you feel like it (optional)


### Instructions:

* In a medium sized mixing bowl, add chickpeas, red onion, garlic, parsley, mint, salt, 1/4 cup panko, 1 tablespoon of avocado oil, juice of lemon, cumin, coriander, cayenne (if using), paprika (if using), and cilantro (if using). Using a potato masher, mash everything together until you get a mostly smooth consistency, with the occasional chickpea chunk. 

* Add the flour and mix until incorporated.

* Pre-heat oven to 375 degrees.

* Lightly grease a baking sheet (I like to put aluminum foil on the baking sheet and grease the foil - makes for an easier clean up). 

* From the falafel mixture, spoon out small quantities and roll them into a circular shape using your hands. Sprinkle with some panko before placing it on the baking sheet. Repeat until all of the mixture has been used.

* Bake for ~12 minutes, flip the falafel patties, and return to bake for another ~12 minutes.

* Stop here if you would like true baked falafel. If you're like me and like them with a little more crisp in them, continue reading.

* On small-medium skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil. Add the falafel and cook for a few minutes until they brown a little. Once you reach desired crispiness, flip the falafel and repeat.

* Remove from heat and serve hot. I like making a falafel bowl - recipe linked [here](https://www.whatsprernacooking.com/mediterranean/vegan/falafel-bowl/)
