Fluffier than the average pancake!

The recipe that I used is adapted from [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/aebleskiver/)

### Ingredients:

_Per 7-8 small-medium sized pancakes:_

* .6 cup all purpose flour
* 1/3 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/3 teaspoon salt
* 1 large egg, separated
* .6 cups milk (I used oat milk due to lactose intolerance)
* maple syrup (as topping)
* 3-4 strawberries, chopped (as topping)
* powdered sugar (as topping)

### Instructions:

* Combine the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

* Whisk the egg yolk and milk in a small bowl, and set aside.

* In a small mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the egg white until soft peaks form. Set aside.
