The perfect snack for a game night or gathering.

The recipe I used is adapted from [NYTimes Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020983-pierogi-ruskie-potato-and-cheese-pierogi)

### Ingredients:

Per 50-60 mini pierogis.

_For the potato mix:_

* 2 lbs potatoes (I used 1 lb russet and 1 lb gold)
* 6 oz cottage cheese (substitute with farmers cheese or ricotta as desired)
* 1 tablespoon butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes
* 1 teaspoon parsley
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

_For the dough:_

* 3.5-4 cups all purpose flour (plus some extra to dust)
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1 teaspoon salt

* 2 tablespoons butter, if pan frying

### Instructions:

* Boil the potatoes - add cold water to a large pot, add the potatoes, and cook on medium heat for 20-30 minutes until potatoes are tender.

* Meanwhile, make the dough - combine all of the ingredients for the dough except the water. Gradually add the water until you make a dough and knead for a minute or two until smooth.

* Add more water or flour if necessary and then shape the dough into a ball. Cover and set aside for ~20 minutes.

* Once the potatoes are cooked, bring them to a medium bowl and using a potato masher, mash them until smooth with no potato clumps.

* Add the rest of the potato mix ingredients and mix until incorporated. Set aside

* Return to the dough - divide it into two parts and roll out the first part to as thin of a dough as possible without ripping.

*Using the top of a cup, cut out circular shapes and set aside. Re-roll the excess dough and continue cutting out circles until you run out of dough. You should get 25-30 per part of dough (50-60 total).

* Fill each circle with ~1-1.5 tablespoons of potato filling. Fold in half and pinch the edges to create a dumpling. Make sure that the filling is completely enclosed inside - you don't want the potatoes to come out while cooking.

* Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add about 4-5 pierogis at a time (adjust depending on the size of the pot) and boil for about 2-3 minutes until they float to the top.

* If you're pan frying, move them to a pan with the 2 tablespoons of butter and cook each side for a few minutes. Set aside and repeat with remaining pierogis.

* Serve as is, with caramelized onions, or with parsley and enjoy!
