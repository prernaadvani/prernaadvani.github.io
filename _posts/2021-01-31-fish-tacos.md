Comes with a super easy hack!

The hack? Trader Joe's! I use their balela salad and frozen fish sticks, which cuts some time out of making the tacos. (Is this considered cheating?)

### Ingredients:

_Per two tacos:_

* 4 Trader Joe's frozen fish sticks
* 2 flour tortillas (or corn tortillas if you roll that way)
* 4 tablespoons balela salad (make it yourself or buy, I use the one from Trader Joe's)
* 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend (I use [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/old-el-paso-mexico-style-4-cheese-blend-shredded-cheese/0007592530693))
* 2 tablespoons Trader Joe's pepita salsa, [cilantro lime cremosa](https://www.kroger.com/p/herdez-medium-cilantro-lime-salsa-cremosa/0007287887018), [chipotle cremosa](https://www.kroger.com/p/herdez-medium-chipotle-salsa-cremosa/0007287887038), or other sauce of choice
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice (optional)
* cilantro (as garnish, optional)



### Instructions:

* Cook fish sticks according to directions on package.

* In the meantime, warm your tortillas. I like to do this by bending the tortillas into the shape of a taco and putting it in the toaster for a minute or two. Alternatively, you can eat it on the stove. Once heated, set them out on a plate.

* Place two fish sticks in each tortilla, followed by the balela salad, cheese, sauce, lemon juice (if using) and cilantro (if using). Enjoy!
