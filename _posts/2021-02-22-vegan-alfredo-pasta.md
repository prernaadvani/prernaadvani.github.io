As an avid pasta lover, I've been quite skepital of vegan sauces, but this recipe was surprisingly good! 

The recipe that I used is adapted from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021040-vegan-fettuccine-alfredo)

* 8 oz cavatappi pasta (or other pasta of choice)

* pinch of nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika (plus some extra as garnish)
* 1/4 teaspoon parsley (plus some extra as garnish)
