The first time I tried a Japanese sweet potato was on a camping trip in freezing cold temperatures, and they've had a special place in my heart ever since.

The recipe that I used is adapted from [A Family Feast](https://www.afamilyfeast.com/miso-glazed-japanese-sweet-potatoes/).

### Ingredients:

Per 6-8 servings:

_For the potatoes:_

* 2 large japanese sweet potatoes
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* pepper, to taste

_For the glaze:_

* 1 tablespoon butter (I used the vegan kind)
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons white miso paste
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* sesame seeds, as garnish


### Instructions:

* Preheat oven to 425 degrees.

* Scrub the potatoes and cut off any blemishes or weird skin spots. Then, begin chopping them into cubes. The potatoes oxidize *very* quickly, so as you're dicing, add them to a bowl and coat with olive oil constantly. 

* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and move the potatoes over. Pour any excess olive oil from the bowl over the potatoes, and top with pepper.

* Next, make the glaze. In a medium pot, melt the butter and add the garlic. On low heat, add the rest of the ingredients and whisk to combine.
