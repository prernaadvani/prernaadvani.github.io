Super quick and super easy, it's an especially great post-workout meal!

Sharing my dad's recipe - to make this the way that he does, buy chicken breasts and grill it yourself instead of buying frozen. Thanks, dad!

### Ingredients:

_Per two tacos:_

* 1/4 red bell pepper, cut lengthwise
* 1/4 green bell papper, cut lengthwise
* 1/4 onion, cut lengthwise
* 2 tablespoons taco seasoning (I use [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/kroger-original-taco-seasoning/0001111071503))
* 5-6 small fully cooked chicken fajita strips (I use [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/tyson-grilled-ready-fully-cooked-fajita-chicken-strips/0002370001628))
* 2 flour tortillas (or corn tortillas if you roll that way)
* 1/4 cup taco sauce (I use [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/ortega-thick-smooth-mild-taco-sauce/0003900000890))
* 1/4 cup shredded Mexican cheese blend (I use [this one](https://www.kroger.com/p/old-el-paso-mexico-style-4-cheese-blend-shredded-cheese/0007592530693))
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice (optional)
* cilantro (as garnish, optional)



### Instructions:

* In a small skillet, add the red bell peppers, green bell peppers, onion, taco seasoning, and chicken strips. Cook for 5-6 minutes until the peppers and onion have softened, and the chicken is heated all the way through.

* In the meantime, warm your tortillas. I like to do this by bending the tortillas into the shape of a taco and putting it in the toaster for a minute or two. Alternatively, you can also heat it on the stove. Once heated, set them out on a plate.

* Once the taco filling on the skillet is cooked and ready to go, split the mixture into two and fill each tortilla.

* Finish up by adding your toppings - add the taco sauce to both tacos, followed by the cheese.
