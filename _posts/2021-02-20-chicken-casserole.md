Perfect for a meal prep!

Note: I used dairy free butter, milk, and cheese, so my images may look very different from yours. Specifically, your non-vegan cheese will melt and brown in a much more beautiful way than mine did (curse you, lactose intolerance).

### Ingredients:

Per 3-4 servings:

_For the chicken:_

* 1 lb chicken breast, skinless and boneless (optional: marinate in lemon pepper seasoning and 1 tablespoon oil over night)
* 1/2 tablespoon butter

_For the vegetables:_

* 1/2 tablespoon butter
* 1 teaspoon Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 1/2 green bell pepper, diced

_For the sauce:_
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 3/4 cup chicken broth
* 3/4 cup milk 
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese
* salt, to taste
* pepper, to taste

_For the topping:_
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese
* 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese (use a little more if you're using real mozzarella and not the vegan kind)


### Instructions:

* First, cut the chicken in cubes.

* Next, cook the vegetables. Heat the butter in a small pot and add the seasoning. Wait ~30-60 seconds, and then add the vegetables. Saute for ~5 minutes until soft. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

* Next, make the sauce. Heat the butter in a small pot and then add the flour. Stir constantly and let the mixture brown for a minute or two. Very gradually, add the broth and milk. Make sure to stir continuously to prevent the formation of clumps. Add the spices and let the sauce thicken for a few minutes. Then, add the cheese and stir to combine. Add the salt and pepper, to taste.

* Drain any excess liquid from the chicken and vegetables, and then add it to the sauce. Mix to combine.

* Lightly grease an 8x8 dish and transfer the mixture over.

* Bake for 20 minutes covered with aluminum foil. Uncover and bake for another 5-10 minutes to brown the cheese (vegan cheese, unfortunately, will not brown). Let it cool for a few minutes and enjoy!
